# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

#Tuples are written with round brackets.
#1
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
#2
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
#3 Print the second item in the tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])
#4 Change Tuple Values
#Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

#But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)
#5
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)
#6 
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)
#7
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)
#8
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists
# Unpacking tuples
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
#2 Assign the rest of the values as a list called "red":
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
# Loop tuples
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
  print(x)
#2 
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for i in range(len(thistuple)):
  print(thistuple[i])
#3 
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
i = 0
while i < len(thistuple):
  print(thistuple[i])
  i = i + 1
# Join tuples
tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)
#2
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
mytuple = fruits * 2

print(mytuple)
